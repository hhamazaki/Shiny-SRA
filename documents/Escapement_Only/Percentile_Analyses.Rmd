# Percentile Analysis:
Percentile analysis method is first developed by Bue and Hasbrouck (unpublished) (See [Bue et al. 2002](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/RIR.2A.2002.35.pdf)) that was further evaluated by [Clark et al. 2014](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMS14-06.pdf).  
This method is  aimed to keep escapements at levels that have been observed. The range also is more likely to encompass Smsy.

The Percentile method has 3 tiers with specific selection criteria:

* **Tier 1: Goal Range: 20th - 60th percentile** 
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Low to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 2: Goal Range: 15th - 65th percentile**
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * Low measurement error (weir or tower surveys)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 3 Goal Range: 5th - 65th percentile**
  * Low escapement contrast ( < 8)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Use of the Percentile approach is NOT recommended**
  * Very low escapement contrast (< 4)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Moderate to high assumed average harvest rate (> 40%)
