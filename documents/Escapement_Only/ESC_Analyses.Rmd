# Escapement data requirements

The Escapement Only Analyses Methods are based on the assumptions that **salmon population has been sustainable at observed historical escapement range** and thus **the population will be sustainable at the observed historical range**.  
To meet this assumption escapement only data should have following qualities: 
* Escapements are accurate with low survey errors. 
* Escapements are  sufficiently long.
* Escapements have good contrasts (e.g. >4)
* Escapements have no discernible trends (e.g., increasing, declining)
* Assumed harvest rates are low to moderate

## When escacapement data do not meet the analyses requirements....
While using the escapement only analyses are not recommended when data do not meet the requirement, you may still need an escapement goal.
