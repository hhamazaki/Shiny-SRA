# Escapement data requirements

The Escapement Only Analyses Methods are based on the assumptions that **a salmon population has been sustainable at observed historical escapement range** and thus **the population will be sustainable at the observed historical range**.  

To meet this assumption escapement only data should have following qualities: 
* Data are sufficiently long (e.g., several generations of salmon have returned).
* Escapement data are accurate with low survey errors. 
* Escapement has a good contrast (e.g. >4)
* Escapement has no discernible trends (e.g., increasing, declining)
* Assumed harvest rates are low to moderate

## When escacapement data do not meet the analyses requirements....
While using the escapement only analyses are not recommended when data do not meet the requirement, you may still need an escapement goal.
