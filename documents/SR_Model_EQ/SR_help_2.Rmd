# Biological Reference Parameters

Following biological reference points are generated from the model 
* Seq   Spawner abundance expected to produce the same number of recruits
* Smsy  Spawner abundance expected to produce the maximum number of yield (MSY) 
* Umsy  Exploitation rate at Rmax that is expected to produce MSY
* Smax  Spawner abundance expected to produce the maximum number of recruits.  
* Sgen  Spawner abundance expected to produce recruitment size of Smsy. Sgen is a conservation benchmark used by Department of Ocean Canada (DFO)

**Ricker model** 
$$Seq =  \frac{ln(\alpha)}{\beta}$$
Smsy and Umsy of Riker model is an approximate where 0 < $ln(\alpha)$ < 3  (Hilbon 1985) $$Smsy =  Seq(0.5-0.07ln(\alpha))$$
$$Umsy =  ln(\alpha)(0.5-0.07ln(\alpha))$$
$$Smax =  \frac{1}{\beta}$$
Note: Smax does not practically exist when $ln(\alpha) < 1$.

**Sgen** is approximated by numerically solving $S$ in following equation
$$ln(\alpha)-\beta Sgen + ln(Sgen) - ln(Smsy) = 0$$


**Beverton-Holt model** 
$$Seq =  \frac{\alpha -1}{\beta}$$
$$Smsy =  \frac{\sqrt{\alpha} -1}{\beta}$$
$$Umsy = 1- \sqrt{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$$
**Beverton-Holt model does not have Smax**
$$Smax = NA$$

**Sgen** is approximated by numerically solving $S$ in following equation  

$$ln(\alpha) - ln(1+\beta Sgen) + ln(Sgen) - ln(Smsy) = 0$$

**When using lognormal bias corrected model, replace $\alpha$ and $ln(\alpha)$ with $\alpha.c$ and $ln(\alpha.c)$.**
