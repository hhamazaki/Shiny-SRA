## Escapement Only Analyses
A formal stock assessment analysis requires sapawner (escapement) and recruit data.  But, in many cases only escapement data are available. 
This often occurs in the case of mixed stock fisheries, such as
* Fisheries occur at a river mouth, and escapement is monitored at a few tributaries. 
* Fisheries occur at a bay where multiple rivers drain. 

In such cases, two alternative escapement goal setting methods are available: Percentile and Risk analysis methods.  

### Percentile method:
Percentile analysis method is first developed by Bue and Hasbrouck (unpublished) (See [Bue et al. 2002](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/RIR.2A.2002.35.pdf)) that was further evaluated by [Clark et al. 2014](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMS14-06.pdf).  
This method is  aimed to keep escapements at levels that have been observed.   The range also is more likely to encompass Smsy.

The Percentile method has 3 tiers with specific selection criteria:

* **Tier 1: Goal Range: 20th - 60th percentile** 
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Low to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 2: Goal Range: 15th - 65th percentile**
  * High escapement contrast (> 8)
  * Low measurement error (weir or tower surveys)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Tier 3 Goal Range: 5th - 65th percentile**
  * Low escapement contrast (< 8)
  * Lowe to moderate assumed average harvest rate (< 40%)

* **Use of the Percentile approach is NOT recommended**
  * Very low escapement contrast (< 4)
  * High measurement error (aerial or foot surveys)
  * Moderate to high assumed average harvest rate (> 40%)  



### Risk analysis method: 
Risk analysis method method is developed by [Bernad et al. 2009](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/SP09-09.pdf). This analysis is aimed to develop an escapement goal for a non-targeted stocks that are harvested **incidentally**.  In this case, management objective of the non-targeted stock is providing setting a precautionary reference points (PRPs): a spawning abundance that has low probability of management concern. 

The Risk analysis assess probability that series of low escapements occur in a row (and thus cause management concern) given that **(1) the stock productivity remained the same** and **(2) the stock productivity is reduced.**

Fishery management risk has two sides: 

* **Risk of action when the action is unwarranted** 
  * This is a risk of activating management concern actions when a stock productivity did not decline. 
  * Series of low escapement events occurred. 

* **Risk of inaction when the action is warranted** 
  * This is a risk of NOT activating management concern actions when a stock productivity declined. 
  * Series of low escapement events did not occur. 

At a given escapement level, the risk analyses method conducts a forward simulation and estimates (1) a probability of a stock getting below the escapement for **consecutive X years**  given that the stock productivity  did not change (i.e., the probability of unwarranted action) and  (2) a probability of a stock **NOT** getting below the escapement for **consecutive X years**  given that the stock productivity is **reduced by Y%** (i.e., the probability of inaction).

To use the risk analyses you must have some management objectives:
* Level of % drop productivity: How much % drop of productivity warrants management action?
* Years of consecutive failures: What is a criteria for an action? 
* Level of acceptable risks: How much risks are you willing to take? (risk of action and inaction?)
* Balance of the two risks: You may not find no escapement level that meet both risks perfectly. Which risks are more concerning for managment>? 


## Caution:
The above Escapement Only Analyses Methods are based on the assumptions that **salmon population has been sustainable at observed historical escapement range** and thus **the population will be sustainable at the observed historical range**.  To meet this assumption, (1) the observed escapements are  sufficiently long and (2) no discernible trends in escapement.  

Consideration of (2) is especially important when there are changes in escapement, such as the case when most of low escapement occurred in recent years. In this case, **there is no empirical evidence to support that the stock is sustainable under those low escapement periods.**  Should those years be included in determining the goal range?
