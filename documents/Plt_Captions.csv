plt_MSY.mc,"SR plot overlayed with probability distribution of Seq, Smsy, Smax, and Sgen.  Vertical line indicate median estimates."
plt_kobe,"Kobe Plot: Escapement vs Harvest Rate by calendar year. Vertical line is Smsy and hoizontal line is Umsy.  Generally, the upper left (>Umsy and <Smsy) is considered an unsustainable state, and the lower right (<Umsy and >Smsy) is perfectly sustainable state."
plt_hist.mc,Probability distribution of reference parameters. The vertical line indicates mean.
plt_Smsy_prof,MSY Profile Analyses Plot.  The profile line indiate the probability of yield exceeding x% of RMAX at given escapement.  Intersecion of the probablity profile and target probability (red line) shows the range of escapement meeting the criteria.
plt_Rmax_prof,RMAX Profile Analyses Plot.  The profile line indiate probability of recruit exceeding x% of RMAX at given escapement.  Intersecion of the probablity profile and target probability (red line) shows the range of escapement meeting the criteria.
plt_msyprof_r,MSY Optimal profile plot. Each ridge indicates a range of Escapement in which the yield exceeding  x % of MSY. The profile line indicates the proportion of ridges that intersected at given Escapement.
plt_maxprof_r,Rmax Optimal profile plot. Each ridge indicates a range of Escapement in which the yield exceeding x % of Rmax. The profile line indicates the proportion of ridges that intersected at given Escapement.
