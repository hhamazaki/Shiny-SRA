# Methods
## Spawner Recruit Model
The spawner-recruit data are fitted to the **Ricker (1957)** model. 

$$R = \alpha Se^{-\beta S}e^{\varepsilon}$$
**Log-linear form**
$$R = ln.\alpha -\beta S+ln(S) +\varepsilon $$
where $ln.\alpha = ln(\alpha)$, $s_{y} = S_{y}\cdot{10}^{-d}$ and $d = Int(log(\bar{S}))$.   

where 
$$\varepsilon_{iid} \sim N(0,\sigma ^{2})$$
## Model data fitting

In data fitting of the model, recruit ($R_{y}$) derived from the y-th brood year spawner ($S_{y}$) is assumed to be log-normally distributed with mean $\mu_{y}$ and variance ${\sigma}^{2}$
 
$$ln(R_{y}) \sim N(\mu_{y},{\sigma}^{2})$$
where $\mu_{y}$ is a log-linearlized Ricker spawner-recruit model 

$$\mu_{y} = ln.\alpha -\beta s_{y}+ln(S_{y})$$

In the above equations, the conversion from $S$ to $s$ makes $\beta$ to a range similar to the range of $ln.\alpha$.  This is numerically more efficient to estimate parameters. 



## Biological Reference Parameters
Following biological reference parameters are generated from the model 
* Seq   Spawner abundance expected to produce the same number of recruits
* Smsy  Spawner abundance expected to produce the maximum number of yield (MSY) 
* Umsy  Exploitation rate expected to produce MSY
* Smax  Spawner abundance expected to produce the maximum number of recruits.  
* Sgen  Spawner abundance expected to produce recruitment size of Smsy. Sgen is a conservation benchmark used by Department of Ocean Canada (DFO)

$$S_{eq} =  \frac{ln.\alpha}{\beta}$$
Smsy and Umsy of the Riker model is an approximate where 0 < $ln(\alpha)$ < 3  (Hilbon 1985) 
$$S_{msy} =  S_{eq}(0.5-0.07ln.\alpha)$$
$$U_{msy} =  ln.\alpha(0.5-0.07ln.\alpha)$$
$$S_{max} =  \frac{1}{\beta}$$
**Note** 
Smax does not **practically** exist when ln.alpha or ln.alpha.c is less than 1.0. This is because the Smax (spawner size that produces RMAX) will be **greater** than Seq 

**Sgen** is approximated by numerically solving $S$ in following equation
$$ln.\alpha-\beta S_{gen} + ln(S_{gen}) - ln(S_{msy}) = 0$$
